## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you need to set up both the backend and frontend. Follow the instructions below to install the required dependencies and start the servers.

---

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the `backend/` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
3. **Set up environment variables:**
**Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder with the following values:**
   ```bash
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-db-uri>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
4. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
**The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`**

---

## Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the `client/` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd client
2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
3. **Run the React app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
**The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`**

---

# Environment Variables

You need to configure environment variables for both the frontend and backend.

- Backend: In the `backend/.env` file
- Frontend: Create an `.env` file inside `client/` if needed, e.g., for API keys or backend URLs:
   ```bash
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
